# kb_uploadmethods

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tgu/kb_uploadmethods.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tgu/kb_uploadmethods)  
[Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md)

## Description

This module implements [KBase](https://www.kbase.us) apps that are used to transform data files into KBase data objects for use in analysis. This also includes a few apps for adding external files to the user's [staging area](https://docs.kbase.us/getting-started/narrative/add-data#uploading-data-from-external-sources), and manipulating them there.

See [here](https://docs.kbase.us/data/upload-download-guide/uploads) for more information on uploading data to KBase.

## Development

This module was created using the KBase SDK. See the [documentation](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/) for more detail. Apps are mostly broken down into submodules. Instructions for setting up a local development environment can be found [here](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/tutorial/2_install.html) (note that [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is required).

The main entrypoint is in `lib/kb_uploadmethods/kb_uploadmethodsImpl.py`. Individual apps in that module use one or more utility module to handle different file types. These are all under `lib/kb_uploadmethods/Utils`. Add a new Util module if you're adding an uploader for a new data type.

## Testing

This module can be tested with the following steps, common to all KBase SDK modules.

1.  Install the [KBase SDK](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).
2.  Fetch this module and navigate to it from the console.
3.  Run `kb-sdk test` once - this will initialize the `test_local/test.cfg` file.
4.  Populate the `test_local/test.cfg` file with a KBase authentication token (see [here](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/tutorial/3_initialize.html?highlight=token#set-up-your-developer-credentials) for details). 
5.  Run `kb-sdk test` again.

Once steps 1-4 have been run once, you can just run `kb-sdk test` to run the test suite any time.

-   **entrypoint**: unpack_staging_file

### [Upload File to Staging from Web - v1.0.12](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/kb_uploadmethods/upload_web_file)

-   **app id**: upload_web_file
-   **entrypoint**: unpack_web_file
-   **description**: This App allows users to upload a data file (which may be compressed) from a web URL to the staging area. If the file is compressed (.gz or .zip), it will automatically be uncompressed. It is possible, and indeed encouraged to make use of folders when uploading compressed archives of files. These folders are leveraged by downstream batch processing Apps and enable users to run tools on every file in the folder. We strongly recommend using this method to move large amounts of data easily into KBase because the transfer mechanism is less likely to be interrupted (versus uploading directly from your laptop). Note that both Box and DropBox offer a mechanism to share private files temporarily using links that are only accessible to someone who know what the link address is.
-   **input file types**: any
-   **output type**: none, adds one or more files to the staging area
